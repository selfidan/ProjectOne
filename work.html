          <h2>Schoolcraft College Research Project</h2>
          <p>During my last semester at my former college I had the oppurtunity to conduct a research project 
             under my previous physics professor. I worked with two other classmates to create a immersive lab 
             activity for students to gain an introduction to concepts such as: kinematics, circitry, and programming. 
             My professor in turn made this a permanent lab activity in his Physics I course.

          <h2>Venus Controls Industries</h2>
          <p>While gaining my Associate in Engineering, I worked as a part time electrican technican. I gained an immense
            amount of knowledge in circuits, panels, blueprints, along with so much more. I was able to understand 
            the more hands-on aspects of technology and engineering through this work.

          <h2>Roush Industries Noise and Vibration</h2>
          <p>I completed a three month internship at Roush Industries in Livonia, Mi. I also gained a lot of pratical experiance
             through this internship as I was tasked mainly with testing materials in a lab. I have a greater understanding of the chemistry
             and properties of materials as I would often test the freezing/melting points of various materials. 
             This internship was both an immense amount of fun, as well as super interesting and educational.

          <h2>Wayne State Environmental Engineering Lab</h2>
          <p>I completed a four month internship at Wayne State's Environmental Engineering lab. I was assigned to a 
             research project on the creation of a bio-fuel out of algae. I was only present for the beginning stages of
             the study, but gained knowledge in algae, biology, as well as chemistry and critical thinking. I will also note
             that I was tasked with monitoring the algae which was incredibly fun.
