CRITERIA FOR PORTFOLIO PEER REVIEW (DUE: 11/09/2020)

1.) Submit a (minimum four page) site.

All of the pages must use a common header, footer, 
and navigation across all pages.

Each page must have a unique title

Using the browser of your choice, 
click on each page to show us that it works. 
As you do, make sure to demo the changes in the navigation and 
that "Skip To Content" works on EVERY page.

2.)The navigation must clearly display the current page 
within the nav element.

As you visit each page, point out how the navigation bar 
changes to clearly indicate which page you are currently viewing. 

Don't forget, color alone should never be used to signify important 
information.

3.)Each page should contain a main section that can be reached using 
a Jump to Content option with the first tab on the page. 
Main must be after the navigation.

To demo this, select "Skip to Content" and then hit tab again. 
Show us where the focus is now.

4.)Minimum content present. 
This includes a page that has at least nine (9) images.

5.)Grid - used more than once, and used effectively.

Using the browser of your choice, 
walk us through the different areas you used grid. 
Explain how you used them differently than in homework. 
Show us all of the pages that use them.

6.)Flex - used more than once, and used effectively.

Using the browser of your choice, walk us through the different areas
you used flexbox. 
Explain how you used them differently than in homework. 
Show us all of the pages that use them.

7.)At least one CSS generated animation that is NOT part of the gallery.

Show us the animation AND the code. 
Change something in the code to make the animation last twice as long.

8.)A working contact form.

Show us the email you receive after clicking on the form.

9.)A parallax image

10.)A keyboard accessible flip card using just CSS

Demonstrate that the flipcard works using a mouse AND the keyboard.

11.)Google Analytics on all four pages.

In realtime show your Google Analytics dashboard as you enter
and leave all four pages of your site. 
We should be able to see multiple past visitors on each page.

12.)Visually appealing

What did you do to make your page particularly appealing? 
Tell us more about your font choices, image editing, etc. 
I am sure are things that you did that we can't easily see.

13.)Media Query One

Using the browser of your choice, 
walk us through the different responsive design choices you made. 
Make sure to impress us. 
The changes should be drastic, obvious, 
and should improve the look/functionality of the site.

14.)Media Query Two

Using the browser of your choice, 
walk us through the different responsive design choices you made. 
Make sure to impress us. The changes should be drastic, obvious, 
and should improve the look/functionality of the site.

15.)Reduced Motion Media Query

All animations/motion should be turned off when prefers-reduced motion
is selected. (Use Safari when you are demoing this!!!)

16.)Documentation/Demonstration - Responsive Design

Talk to us about why your responsive design is great. 
(You don't need to tell us anything you already told us 
during the media query demonstration.)

17.)Documentation/Demonstration - Validation

Validate all four pages on both aXe and Wave. 
Demo on your deployed page.

18.)Documentation/Demonstration - Accessibility, diversity and inclusion

A summary of the steps you took to ensure that your site addresses 
accessibility, diversity and inclusion.

19.)What did you do that was AMAZING??

The final 15% of this portion of the assignment requires that you
show us the amazing 

- NOT required - things that you added to the page. 

What did you go and learn how to do on your own? 

Where did you learn it? Are you using someone else's code? 
If so, how did you modify it? Did you use Bootstrap 
(in addition to the requirements above)? 

If so, what did you need to do to make it work in the context of 
Your page. Did you do extra accessibility testing? 

Impress us with what you learned. 

Only 10% of the class will get the full 21 points here and it 
would be expected that it is a professional looking site with NO 
validation errors. (Other than titles on iframes and movie captions.
Speaking of which, that could be an extra!)

You are welcome to set up a demo to walk us through your extras.
